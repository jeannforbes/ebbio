    <h2>First Look</h2>
    <p>A new player spawns in as a little organism. This player will see other particles around them. They move their mouse, the little player-orb follows it.</p>
    <p>The player eats a parasite and gets a little bigger. That orb vanishes. The player sees another player, bigger than them.</p>
    <p>That other player bites the intrepid newbie, who shrinks and has little particles come out of their body.</p>
    <p>Confused, the intrepid newbie pushes buttons to try and fight back, but is unable to harm their aggressor and dies.</p>
    <p>The newbie spawns in again. This time, nobody attacks them and they grow more.</p>
    <p>When they gain enough mass, the newbie is given a choice of weapons to have after evolving. </p>
    <p>Remembering how effective it was when they were bitten, the newbie decides to evolve a powerful bitin' jaw.</p>
    <p>Now prowling the world, the less-fresh newbie finds themself some fresh meat and devours them whole, growing and evolving all the while.</p>
    <p>Steam vents populate the world, spewing particles of delicousness</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ebbio is a mouse-controlled online multiplayer game.</p>
    <p>The goal is to be the largest thing in the world for as long as you can.</p>
    <p>Players are represented by organisms that follow the mouse.</p>
    <p>Upgrades add little organs to the player's body.</p>
    <p>Players consume crumbs on the map to increase in mass.</p>
    <p>At certain Growth Thresholds, players become temporarily immortal and can choose between a pair of skills- some active, some passive.</p>
    <p>At the third Growth Threshold, players choose to become a Symbiote or Parasite.</p>

    <h2>Symbiotes</h2>
    <p>Symbiotes are cooperative players that focus on growing in teams inside the bodies of bigger Symbiotes.</p>
    <p>The bodies of large Symbiotes contain hotspots, which spawn green Symbiote Crumbs.</p>
    <p>When entering large Symbiotes, small Symbiotes play a defense game around the Symbiote's hotspots, protecting them from Parasites.</p>
    <p>Symbiotes are immune to the attacks of other Symbiotes, and when damaged only produce Parasite Crumbs.</p>
    <p>Symbiote expansion is represented by a cluster of smaller organs growing around their main body.</p>

    <h2>Parasites</h2>
    <p>Parasites are singular players that focus on eating Symbiotes and other Parasites.</p>
    <p>Parasites are snake-like creatures, smaller than Symbiotes but denser and unable to be entered.</p>
    <p>Parasites enter the bodies of large Symbiotes, attacking the hotspots. Destroyed hotspots drop a large amount of red Parasite Crumbs.</p>
    <p>Parasites can damage all other players, and produce Parasite crumbs when damaged.</p>
    <p>Parasite expansion is represented by new organs being added to their body.</p>
    
    <h2>Mechanics</h2>
    <p>The first Growth Threshold is at 20 mass, the second at 50. After that, the Growth Threshold doubles every time.</p>
    <p>Before becoming a parasite or symbiote, new Growth Thresholds are represented by additional organs on the player's body.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing Teeth on Growth Threshold 1 will cause your organism to sprout a little jaw.</li>
      <li>Choosing spikes will cause a long horn to sprout out the front of your organism.</li>
      <li>On Growth Threshold 2, choosing the shield will cause a flexible, dark shield to appear on the left side of the player's organism.</li>
      <li>Choosing Dive will add little fins to the back of a player's organism.</li>
    </ul>
